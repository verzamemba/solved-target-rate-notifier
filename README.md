A Currency broker company has asked us to build a system that notifies them when a currency pair rate reaches the target rate. User configures the currency pair and target rate.

The URL to get the Rates in XML form: “http://rates.fxcm.com/RatesXML”

Example of the rate:

&lt;Rate Symbol=”EURUSD”&gt;

&lt;Bid&gt;1.38022&lt;/Bid&gt;

&lt;Ask&gt;1.38042&lt;/Ask&gt;

&lt;High&gt;1.38266&lt;/High&gt;

&lt;Low&gt;1.37634&lt;/Low&gt;

&lt;Direction&gt;0&lt;/Direction&gt;

&lt;Last&gt;10:42:43&lt;/Last&gt;

&lt;/Rate&gt;

Here “Bid” is the current rate. “Ask” is the suggested sell rate. “High” is day high, “Low” is day low, “Direction” is 1=&gt;up, -1=&gt;down, 0=&gt;no change compared to last rate, and “Last” is the time for last tick.

Design considerations:

———————-

1. You will need a parser to parse the XML. There are several examples online.

2. Start with hard coded user configuration. For example. Pair: EURUSD, Target rate: 1.381

3. Make it user entry once you have working code.

4. You will periodically check the rates, consider using a schedular.

4. For notification, we will assume that there is a system that will be called to notify users. You only display it on the screen if target has been reached.
